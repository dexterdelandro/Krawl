 A split scren multiplayer game I made with 3 teammates for an Academic Project with MonoGame.
 
 I created the game logic, which included spawning enemies, and progressing the stats of enemies and weapons over time.
 I also worked on the phsyics system alongside a teammate, creating the friction in the game and the way the character
 bounces off of the walls and the enemies.
